# Simple ChatApp created with boost asio and OpenSSL
This will be a simple app created with c++, boost asio and OpenSSL. I want to practice some of my networking skills and coding which is why I have created this project. In the future I may also add:\
- Docker containerization
- google unit tests
- Jenkins builds

# Building
To build the project use cmake as follows.\
`cmake -B ./build -S .`\
That should create everything for you in the builds folder. If you are using Visual studio then a solution should be created with Server and Client projects inside. You can then run these just like any other project. Have fun :)
